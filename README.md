# A jQuery Accordian plugin

This project is an accordian plugin used by TSC on the category and product results pages.
Unfortunately it expects a specific dom layout to work but I will be working to make it more flexible in the future.

**Example markup.**

```javascript
    <h2 acccordian="true">click me </h2>  
    <ul class="showme">  
      <li>content to show/hide</li>  
      <li>content to show/hide</li>  
    </ul>  
```

**Usage:**
```javascript
    $(".LeftColumn").tscAccordian({})  
```
